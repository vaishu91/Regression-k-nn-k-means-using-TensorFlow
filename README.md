# Regression-k-nn-k-means-using-TensorFlow
Tensor flow implementation of regression, k-nn, k-means for structured data using csv file
Problem Definition:
Download any labeled and unlabeled dataset and implement the tenseflow version of standard regression, kmeans, and k-NN algorithms to understand the workings of tf. Also compare the implementation with reference to code written in previous plractical without use of TensorFlow.
